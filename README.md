# Traveling Salesman Problem

## Task
Find the cheapest way to visit all the cities and return to your starting point. 

![TSP_graph](img/TSP_graph.png)  
Graph with finite number of points and the cost of travel between each pair. The travel costs are symmetric (there are direct and reverse paths between 2 nodes). The goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle with the minimum total weight.  
Create a table with named nodes using structure {point1, point2, cost} and fill data based on a picture.  
Write a SQL statement that returns all tours with minimum travel cost if we start from city "A".
